# About
<img src="IMG_5071.JPG" alt="picture of Clemens">

My Name is Clemens. What interests me about our history is the mysterious, the mystical, and the hidden, and I convey what interests me with enthusiasm. I work as a historian, designing permanent and special exhibitions for museums around the world. Previously, I worked as a history teacher, among other things. I am an experienced tour guide. I studied history and art history at universities in Germany and the Netherlands, among other subjects. I enjoy traveling, and I love engaging intensively with other cultures and languages. I speak German, English, French, and Italian.
